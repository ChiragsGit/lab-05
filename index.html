                I spawned onto earth in 1996. To be exact, it was in Punjab, India. I teleported to Canada in 2004 and
                have
                had many spawn points across Ontario. Recently it is in Barrie, ON.

                I currently have 2 beautiful dogs with my fiance, one is a black Pug/Brussels Griffon mixed named Ella
                who
                is turning 7 in January and a white Husky Shepherd mix named Freya turning 2 in November.

                I have attended the University of Lakehead for BComm. My biggest achievement is buying a home during the
                midst of the pandemic. My goal is to be a lazy coder.
